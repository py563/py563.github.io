The proposed platform would be like a social network with inputs from travel bloggers, professional travelers, and local users.\nProduct We at Yayin would like to be the change for the travel industry. The web platform will categorize visited places by users into intelligent trips. Then from supplied user social profile, the learning algorithm will learn from trips, inputs from travel blogs and local volunteer ambassadors, and other trained data from surveys, Facebook or foursquare will recommend such trips and itinerary from a city “A” or user's hometown to city “B”. These trips would either be through road or flight with stopovers. In the future, we would like to highlight sponsored trips for advertising and monetization.\nCareers We are looking for freelancers, developers, and data scientists to contribute to the project, the team at Yayin will compensate developers with equity in the company.\nTo learn more about Yayin and for open positions please visit our AngelList profile.\n","permalink":"https://prajwalyashasvi.in/projects/creations/yayin/","tags":["Python","Javascript","React","Github","ML","AI"],"title":"Yayin (or) TBD"}]
